## About This Repo

This Hackathon came at the end of a Work Experience Programme I participated in with JP Morgan in their new Glasgow office. Participants were given a 30-page document detailing, the rules, technologies to use and instructions on how to use them along with sample code. Requirements for the final website were as follows:
- Must be a PWA (Progressive Web App)
- Must have a home page.
- Have at least 2 separate API calls one of which must take in a parameter from the user to make the call.
- Use of GET Request method.
- A navigation bar.
- Use of CSS Framework such as Bootstrap
- Consistent styling through the app
- Cross platform elements on at least one page
- General understanding and explanation of code
- Originality of idea
- User friendly
##### Bonus
- Accessibility
- Other API Request Types used such as POST.
- Interactive features
- In depth error handling and validation

The Rules were pretty standard for this sort of thing (no AI, no excessive copy-pasting from the internet, no work after judging starts, no making your mentor do everything, etc)

To complete this Hackathon we were assigned a mentor who was a JP Morgan employee and tasked with helping us wherever possible without writing the full project (resolving git conflicts, helping configure Codespaces, etc). For many of us, this was our first time working with tools like Git/GitHub, GitHub Codespaces and serveral were also new to HTML/CSS/JS as a whole. While I was familiar with Git and VSCode (which is what GitHub Codespaces essentially runs on) I was new to working on the same repository with other people and thus having to resolve conflicts and divide and conquer.

The first hour or so was spent finalising the design, API and layout we'd use, along with learning the ropes of the new tools we had at hand. The next few hours were spent writing some light code and working out the rough design before lunch.
After lunch, the real stress set in when we realised we only really had 2 hours left until it was all presented to the judges. Code was finalised, PRs submitted and merged and the website began to take shape. As the last 30 minutes drew near, it was panic to resolve merge conflicts, ensure deploys worked and implement consistent use of footers and colours that would make the judges happy. Eventually though, they came to our meeting room and we presented our website where they seemed happy. Something we later found out when we scored 3rd overall! Hurrah!

## Lessons Learned

This Hackathon taught me a lot of things, notably new skills on how to work collaboratively with a team and help people out where they need it. Also that I need to learn JavaScript more and that asking for help when you need it isn't a bad thing.

Thanks for reading, and thanks to the JP Morgan staff who ran the Work Experience Programme, it was a blast!
